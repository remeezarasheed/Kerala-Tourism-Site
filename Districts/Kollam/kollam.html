        <div class="para">Palaruvi Waterfalls, which literally translates to ‘Stream of Milk’. The white-stream waterfall descending from the height of 300ft resembles the shape of a horse’s tail. An ideal time to visit this place is from June to January.  It is the 32nd highest waterfall in India, also known to have Ayurvedic properties. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it, therefore making it among the best tourist spots in Kollam.

The lake is home for 27 species of freshwater fish. You can do boating and swimming in this lake.
